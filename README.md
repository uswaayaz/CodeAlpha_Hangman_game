# CodeAlpha_Hangman_game

The provided code is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list and prompts the player to guess the letters of the word. 

Key technologies and features : 

The use of the random module to select a random word from the list, and basic control flow mechanisms such as loops (while) and conditional statements (if-else) to manage the game logic. 

The code also employs list operations to keep track of guessed letters and string manipulation to update the display of the word being guessed. Input validation is handled to ensure that the player enters valid single letters, and user feedback is provided throughout the game to indicate correct or incorrect guesses, as well as to display the current state of the word and the number of wrong guesses. The game concludes by either congratulating the player for guessing the word correctly or notifying them of their loss when the maximum number of wrong guesses is reached.
